/**
 @warning Does not currently work under iOS11!  In iOS11, the `SKAction performSelector`
          does not retain its target strongly, despite documentation to the contrary.
          The `HLHacktion` mechanism requires a strong reference in order to retain the
          `HLHacktion` object, which is not retained elsewhere.  As a result, the
          selector is not performed.

 A lightweight encodable object that, when triggered, can perform a selector on a
 weakly-retained target.

 This perform-selector object has two main purposes:

   - to avoid retain cycles caused by `SKAction performSelector:onTarget:`

   - to be an encodable replacement for `SKAction runBlock:`

 ## Avoid Retain Cycles in `SKAction performSelector:onTarget:`

 The perform-selector provided by SpriteKit retains its target strongly, which can lead to
 a retain cycle when the target is the node running the action.  For example, a sequence
 like this is problematic:

     SKAction *delayedPing = [SKAction sequence:@[ [SKAction waitForDuration:1.0],
                                                   [SKAction performSelector:@selector(ping) onTarget:self] ]];
     [self runAction:delayedPing];

 If, during the one-second wait, this node is removed from parent, then its actions will
 be paused (not released!), and the node and action will retain each other strongly.

 To address this, `HLPerformSelectorWeakHacktion` (and its variants) retain their target weakly.

 This module contains "strong" variants of the perform-selector which correspond more
 closely to the behavior of `performSelector:onTarget:`.  They are not recommended.

 ## Encodable Replacement for `SKAction runBlock:`

 This perform-selector and its variants are certainly not as versatile as `SKAction
 runBlock:`, and yet they can be encoded, which might be useful.

 See http://stackoverflow.com/q/35249269/1332415 for context.

 When the node hierarchy is encoded, as is common during application state preservation or
 a "game save", nodes running `SKAction` actions with code blocks must be handled
 specially, since the code blocks cannot be encoded.

 For example, say an orc has been killed.  It is animated to fade out and then remove
 itself from the node hierarchy:

     SKAction *fadeAction = [SKAction fadeOutWithDuration:3.0];
     SKAction *removeAction = [SKAction removeFromParent];
     [orcNode runAction:[SKAction sequence:@[ fadeAction, removeAction ]]];

 If the orc node is encoded and then decoded, the animation will restore properly and
 complete as expected.

 But now the example is modified to use a code block that runs after the fade.  Perhaps
 the code cleans up some game state once the orc is (finally) dead.

     SKAction *fadeAction = [SKAction fadeOutWithDuration:3.0];
     SKAction *removeAction = [SKAction removeFromParent];
     SKAction *cleanupAction = [SKAction runBlock:^{
       [self orcDidFinishDying:orcNode];
     }];
     [orcNode runAction:[SKAction sequence:@[ fadeAction, removeAction, cleanupAction ]]];

 Unfortunately, the code block will not encode.  During application state preservation (or
 game save), if this sequence is running, a warning will be issued:

   > SKAction: Run block actions can not be properly encoded,
   > Objective-C blocks do not support NSCoding.

 After decoding, the orc will fade and be removed from parent, but the cleanup method
 `orcDidFinishDying:` will not be called.

 Instead, use `HLPerformSelectorWeakSingleHacktion` (or another variant).

   - The caller instantiates the perform-selector object and sets its properties: target,
     selector, and arguments.

   - The perform-selector object is triggered in a `runAction` animation by the standard
     no-argument `[SKAction performSelector:onTarget:]`.  For this triggering action, the
     target is the perform-selector object and the selector is a designated `execute`
     method.  (As shorthand, the `action` method of the perform-selector object returns a
     properly constructed `SKAction`.)

   - The perform-selector object conforms to `NSCoding`.

   - As a bonus, the triggering `SKAction` retains a strong reference to the
     perform-selector object, and so both will be encoded along with the node running the
     actions.

 Using convenience methods, the new code would look like this:

     [orcNode runAction:[SKAction sequence:@[ [SKAction fadeOutWithDuration:3.0],
                                              [SKAction removeFromParent],
                                              [HLHacktion performSelector:@selector(orcDidFinishDying:)
                                                             onWeakTarget:self
                                                             withArgument:orcNode] ]]];

 This code sample shows all the steps explicitly, with manual creation of triggering `SKAction`:

     SKAction *fadeAction = [SKAction fadeOutWithDuration:3.0];
     SKAction *removeAction = [SKAction removeFromParent];
     HLPerformSelectorWeakSingleHacktion *cleanupCaller = [[HLPerformSelectorWeakSingleHacktion alloc] initWithWeakTarget:self selector:@selector(orcDidFinishDying:) argument:orcNode];
     SKAction *cleanupAction = [SKAction performSelector:@selector(execute) onTarget:cleanupCaller];
     [orcNode runAction:[SKAction sequence:@[ fadeAction, removeAction, cleanupAction ]]];

 And finally a third variant which is mostly explicit, but using the `action` method shorthand:

     SKAction *fadeAction = [SKAction fadeOutWithDuration:3.0];
     SKAction *removeAction = [SKAction removeFromParent];
     HLPerformSelectorWeakSingleHacktion *cleanupCaller = [[HLPerformSelectorWeakSingleHacktion alloc] initWithWeakTarget:self selector:@selector(orcDidFinishDying:) argument:orcNode];
     [orcNode runAction:[SKAction sequence:@[ fadeAction, removeAction, cleanupCaller.action ]]];

 ## Special Considerations

 When a node is encoded with a running (not yet completed) `SKAction`, and then decoded,
 it will restart the `SKAction` from the beginning.  This is standard SpriteKit behavior.

 The behavior can be surprising, though, when this perform-selector action is running in a
 sequence: Upon decoding, the entire sequence (if it is not yet completed) will restart
 from the beginning, and even if this perform-selector object was performed before
 preservation, it will perform again after restoration.

 See `HLSequenceHacktion` for an alternative; upon decoding, it will not re-run parts of
 the sequence that have already completed.

 ## Example

     [orcNode runAction:[SKAction sequence:@[ [SKAction fadeOutWithDuration:3.0],
                                              [SKAction removeFromParent],
                                              [HLHacktion performSelector:@selector(orcDidFinishDying:) onWeakTarget:self] ]]];

 ## Details

 When the node hierarchy is encoded, as is common during application state preservation or
 a "game save", nodes running `SKAction` actions with code blocks must be handled
 specially, since the code blocks cannot be encoded.

 Use `HLCustomHacktion` rather than `customActionWithDuration:actionBlock:`.

   - The `HLCustomHacktion` is triggered by a companion `[SKAction
     performSelector:onTarget:]`, invoking a designated `execute` method.

   - When it is triggered, the `HLCustomHacktion` tracks its own elapsed time and, when
     notified of a new frame in the `SKScene`, periodically performs the selector on the
     target, passing it the node, the elapsed time, and the duration.

   - `HLCustomHacktion` conforms to `NSCoding`.  When running on a node, it will be
     encoded along with the node.  On decoding, it will continue running.  (The way it
     runs is determined by `SKNode runAction:`.  As noted below in "Limitations", decoded
     `SKAction` sequences are restarted by `runAction:`, so the custom action will restart
     from the beginning after decoding.)

 Duration is a problem.  A `customActionWithDuration:actionBlock:` has a duration, but the
 triggering `SKAction` for the `HLCustomHacktion` does not.  There are at least two
 considerations here:

   - If the triggering action is running in a sequence, any actions sequenced after the
     custom action need to wait for the full configured duration of the custom action.

   - Even if it's not running in a sequence, though: The node's `runAction:` method will
     retain actions as long as it thinks they are running.  This is important so that the
     action will be encoded along with the node.  The custom action should be retained by
     the node for the full configured duration of the custom action.

 Therefore, the triggering action should always be run in a group like this:

     [SKAction group:@[ [SKAction performSelector:@selector(execute) onTarget:aCustomAction],
                        [SKAction waitForDuration:thisObject.duration] ]]

 Use the method `action` for convience, or the `HLHacktion` methods for more convenience.

 ## Example

 A tweening example using the non-encodable `customActionWithDuration:actionBlock:`.

       SKSpriteNode *redNode = [SKSpriteNode spriteNodeWithColor:[SKColor redColor] size:CGSizeMake(100.0f, 100.0f)];
       SKAction *flashInAction = [SKAction customActionWithDuration:3.0 actionBlock:^(SKNode *node, CGFloat elapsedTime){
         CGFloat normalTime = (CGFloat)(elapsedTime / 3.0);
         CGFloat normalValue = BounceEaseOut(normalTime);
         node.alpha = (1.0f - normalValue);
       }];
       [redNode runAction:flashInAction];

 The same effect achieved in an encodable way (using `HLHacktion` convenience method).

        - (void)HL_flashInWithNode:(SKNode *)node elapsedTime:(CGFloat)elapsedTime duration:(NSTimeInterval)duration userData:(id)userData {
          CGFloat normalTime = (CGFloat)(elapsedTime / duration);
          CGFloat normalValue = BounceEaseOut(normalTime);
          node.alpha = (1.0f - normalValue);
        }

        - (void)HL_showFlashingRedNode {
          SKSpriteNode *redNode = [SKSpriteNode spriteNodeWithColor:[SKColor redColor] size:CGSizeMake(100.0f, 100.0f)];
          [redNode runAction:[HLHacktion customActionWithDuration:3.0
                                                         selector:@selector(HL_flashInWithNode:elapsedTime:duration:userData:)
                                                       weakTarget:self
                                                             node:redNode
                                                         userData:nil]];
        }

 ## Limitations

 Currently the custom action does not implement much `SKAction` functionality, including:

   - Timing modes and functions.

   - The ability to pause the custom action when the node is paused.

 Also, notifications are an awkward way to do updates.  Two alternate versions of this
 object have been attempted so far: One that used the `NSObject` runloop (that is, using
 `performSelector:`) to do periodic updates of the custom action, and one that forced the
 caller to make explicit calls to update the custom action (presumably from her `SKScene
 update:`).  Both alternates have their own problems.

 ## Special Considerations

 When a node is encoded with a running (not yet completed) `SKAction`, and then decoded,
 it will restart the `SKAction` from the beginning.  This is standard SpriteKit behavior.

 The behavior can be surprising, though, when this perform-selector action is running in a
 sequence: Upon decoding, the entire sequence (if it is not yet completed) will restart
 from the beginning, and even if this perform-selector object was performed before
 preservation, it will perform again after restoration.

 See `HLSequenceHacktion` for an alternative; upon decoding, it will not re-run parts of
 the sequence that have already completed.

 of its actions that have already completed.

 See http://stackoverflow.com/q/36293846/1332415 for context.

 ## Details

 When a node is encoded with a running `SKAction`, and then decoded, it will restart the
 `SKAction` from the beginning.  This is standard SpriteKit behavior.

 The same behavior holds true for the sequence `SKAction`: upon decoding, if it has not
 yet completed, the entire sequence will restart from the beginning.  Any actions in the
 sequence that completed before encoding will be run again after decoding.

 Sometimes this behavior is undesirable.  It would be hard to rewrite all `SKAction` types
 so that they resumed without restarting, but consider the sequence as a special case.
 Would it possible to run a list of actions in a sequence such that, when each action in
 the sequence completes, it is marked as such, and not re-run after decoding?

 One possibility to that end is to split the sequence into a few independent
 subsequences.  As each subsequence completes, it will no longer be running, and so will
 not be encoded if the application is preserved.  For instance, an original sequence like
 this:

     [self runAction:[SKAction sequence:@[ [SKAction performSelector:@selector(doX) onTarget:self],
                                           [SKAction waitForDuration:10.0],
                                           [SKAction performSelector:@selector(doY) onTarget:self],
                                           [SKAction waitForDuration:1.0],
                                           [SKAction performSelector:@selector(doZ) onTarget:self] ]]];

 could be split like this:

     [self runAction:[SKAction sequence:@[ [SKAction performSelector:@selector(doX) onTarget:self] ]]];

     [self runAction:[SKAction sequence:@[ [SKAction waitForDuration:10.0],
                                           [SKAction performSelector:@selector(doY) onTarget:self] ]]];

     [self runAction:[SKAction sequence:@[ [SKAction waitForDuration:11.0],
                                           [SKAction performSelector:@selector(doZ) onTarget:self] ]]];

 No matter when the node is encoded, the methods `doX`, `doY`, and `doZ` will only be
 run once.

 Depending on the animation, though, the duration of the waits might seem weird.  For
 example, say the application is preserved after `doX` and `doY` have run, during the
 1-second delay before `doZ`.  Then, upon restoration, the application won't run `doX` or
 `doY` again, but it will wait 11 seconds before running `doZ`.

 To avoid the perhaps-strange delays, split the sequence into a chain of dependent
 subsequences, each of which triggers the next one.  For the example, the split might
 look like this:

     - (void)doX
     {
       // do X...
       [self runAction:[SKAction sequence:@[ [SKAction waitForDuration:10.0],
                                             [SKAction performSelector:@selector(doY) onTarget:self] ]]];
     }

     - (void)doY
     {
       // do Y...
       [self runAction:[SKAction sequence:@[ [SKAction waitForDuration:1.0],
                                             [SKAction performSelector:@selector(doZ) onTarget:self] ]]];
     }

     - (void)doZ
     {
       // do Z...
     }

     - (void)runAnimationSequence
     {
       [self runAction:[SKAction performSelector:@selector(doX) onTarget:self]];
     }

 With this implementation, if the sequence is preserved after `doX` and `doY` have run,
 then, upon restoration, the delay before `doZ` will be only 1 second.  Sure, it's a full
 second (even if it was half elapsed before encoding), but the result is fairly
 understandable: Whatever action in the sequence was in progress at the time of encoding
 will restart, but once it completes, it is done.

 `HLSequenceHacktion` is an abstracted version of the described concept.

 Use the method `action` for convience, or the `HLHacktion` methods for more convenience.

 ## Example

 Example using `HLHacktion` convenience method:

     [self runAction:[HLHacktion sequence:@[ [SKAction performSelector:@selector(doX) onTarget:self],
                                             [SKAction waitForDuration:10.0],
                                             [SKAction performSelector:@selector(doY) onTarget:self],
                                             [SKAction waitForDuration:1.0],
                                             [SKAction performSelector:@selector(doZ) onTarget:self] ]
                                 onNode:self]];

 ## Special Considerations

 Should actions in the sequence still be retained once they have completed?  There seems
 no reason to, except perhaps that this object is trying to imitate `SKAction sequence`,
 which **does** retain them for the lifetime of the sequence.  And users might be
 accustomed to such behavior; for instance, `HLCustomAction` depends on it.  So, for now,
 actions in the sequence will be retained for the lifetime of the `HLSequenceHacktion`.

 Another consideration: Nesting this sequence with other groups and sequences will be
 problematic.  The timing will be probably be off: The triggering action for the
 `HLSequenceHacktion` has no duration, and anyway, if this `HLSequenceHacktion` is running
 in parallel to a `SKAction sequence` (or a `SKAction waitForDuration:`), and both are
 encoded, they will be out of sync on decoding.
