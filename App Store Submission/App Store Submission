	A Tour Guide in Your Pocket

Description

	Paddle Station Tours is your new tour-guide for your next trip down the Bow River! While floating or paddling down the Bow River, you can simply point the camera of your phone at different landmarks and points of interest along the banks to learn about the history of the area or other interesting facts. This info shows up right on your phone screen, overlaid on top of what your camera is seeing. Providing an augmented reality (AR) tour of the Bow River Waterway between Shouldice Park and St Patrick's Island, Paddle Station Tours aims to enrich your floating experience! If your phone doesn't support AR, have no fear! You can also check out the cool stuff along the river on the in-app map.

Promotional Text

	New in April: 18 new landmarks have been added along the Bow River Waterway including The Peace Bridge, Simmons Building, and Fort Calgary! Check them out this summer!
